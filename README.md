Time series prediction with LSTM
Exercise 2a is solved by the `generate_ar_k` function in the file `ts_generator.py`
Exercise 2b is solved by the `exercise_2b.py` file
Exercise 3c is solved by the `exercise_2c.py` file.

Note that there is a test file, for checking the stationarity of the AR-K series.
